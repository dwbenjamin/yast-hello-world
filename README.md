# YaST Hello World!
## Simple YaST Hello World module to create minimum structure and a working module.
[![Travis Build](https://travis-ci.org/dwbenjamin/yast-hello-world.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/github/dwbenjamin/yast-hello-world)

I created this project to, help non professional and hobbyist developers and hackers, continue to expand the YaST project. YaST is extremely powerful and a bit overwhelming for a novice or hobbyist, in my opinion.  

In the doc folder you will find a series of documents designed to help from start to finish building of a YaST module.  I will include links to original documentation so you can dig deeper into YaST.  


+ In the **doc** directory:
 1. Read the **START-HERE.md** file to setup your development environment.
 2. Read the **TEAM-DEV.** file to integrate with GitHub.
 3. Read the **OBS.md** file for Open Build Service instructions.


# TODO
## add instructions for customizing
